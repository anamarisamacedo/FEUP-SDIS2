Chunk backup - Enhancement: This scheme can deplete the backup space rather rapidly, and cause too much activity on the nodes once that space is full. Can you think of an alternative scheme that ensures the desired replication degree, avoids these problems, and, nevertheless, can interoperate with peers that execute the chunk backup protocol described above?
Chunk restore protocol - Enhancement: If chunks are large, this protocol may not be desirable: only one peer needs to receive the chunk, but we are using a multicast channel for sending the chunk. Can you think of a change to the protocol that would eliminate this problem, and yet interoperate with non-initiator peers that implement the protocol described in this section? Your enhancement must use TCP to get full credit.
File deletion - Enhancement: If a peer that backs up some chunks of the file is not running at the time the initiator peer sends a DELETE message for that file, the space used by these chunks will never be reclaimed. Can you think of a change to the protocol, possibly including additional messages, that would allow to reclaim storage space even in that event?
